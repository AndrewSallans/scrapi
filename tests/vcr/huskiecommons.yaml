        northern Illinois small-scale farmers, directed by Dr. Emily McKee aims to
        create a profile of farmers in the region. The profile will serve as the preliminary
        stage of developing a larger ethnographic research project of self-described
        \u201Csmall-scale\u201D and \u201Calternative farmers:\u201D in northern Illinois.
        Using an inductive approach, the current study gathers and examines information
        about the methods of agriculture that are being used, and the social profile
        the farmers use to describe themselves. To gather information, the research
        assistant, Emily Knetsch, has collected data about farmers from the internet
        and compiled a list of over 400 farmers in the northern Illinois area; from
        that list, farmers have been contacted by phone and surveyed using an open
        ended questionnaire. Internet research, and phone surveys have gathered information
        such as the number of acres farmed, types of crops produced, and the generation
        of farmer. These data are being condensed, sorted and analyzed for cross-variable
        correlations. The poster presentation for URAD will described the research
        design and procedures, as well as preliminary analysis.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.S.

        purpose of this study is to examine whether the personal characteristics of
        the CEO influence corporate policies. Specifically, how does the CEO\u2019s
        familial status affect the allocation of scarce financial capital to research
        and development and what is the resultant impact on profitability and firm
        value? Financial data for 14,650 firm-year observations of the S&amp;P 500
        firms from the years 1992 to 2012 is gathered from corporate proxy statements
        and 10Ks, and then it is analyzed using regressions. While previous research
        shows that family firms and founder firms result in a higher level of firm
        performance, our study shows that it is the presence of children of the CEOs
        of these family and founder firms that show this result. Return on assets
        and Tobin\u2019s Q are higher when founder firm and family firm CEOs have
        children, which means these firms are more profitable and are valued higher.
        This can be explained by the lower overhead expenditures and higher R&amp;D
        and advertising for firms with children. This is likely due to founder and
        family CEOs having a desire to invest in the future of the firm because they
        are developing a legacy for their children</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        Klimt</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Athena</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Women
        are the predominate subject of Gustav Klimt\u2019s oeuvre, from his beautiful
        portraits of women patrons and acquaintances, to his murals for the Old Burgtheater,
        University, and Kunsthistorisches Museum.   One woman who appears multiple
        times in Klimt\u2019s work is the goddess Athena.  Athena is the goddess of
        wisdom, military victory, reason, intelligent activity, and arts and literature.
        \ With these attributes in mind we begin to take a closer look at the works
        of art that Klimt included Athena in, the context that the figures are placed
        in, and for what purpose they were made.  Did Klimt portray Athena in a certain
        way to highlight one of her attributes?  Why was Athena a recurring figure
        for Klimt?  I will focus mainly on three of Gustav Klimt\u2019s works that
        include Athena and look at the different ways he portrayed the goddess in
        each piece, including: the mural on the wall of the Kunsthistorisches museum
        in Vienna, the poster for the first Secession Exhibition, and his painting
        titled Pallas Athena.  While there are a few other representations of Athena
        by Klimt, I will focus on these three, which are the most prominent and well
        known.  I will also look at other representations of Athena found throughout
        the city of Vienna.  In particular I will consider the fountain in front of
        the Parliament building, the mosaic at the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts,
        and the owls, a symbol of Athena, on the Secession building, to gain further
        insight into the importance of the goddess within the city of Vienna.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        goal of our study is to investigate family member roles within postsecondary
        settings for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder. There is a paucity of
        research so this study will add knowledge to the topic. We interviewed 8 disability
        resource center staff members at community colleges in the northern Illinois
        region. The main goal of the interview was to find out staff\u2019s viewpoint
        on family involvement. Some examples of questions asked in the interview are,
        \u201CDo you have any experiences interacting with family members of students
        with ASD?\u201D and \u201CDo you offer specific services or programming that
        includes family members of students with ASD?\u201D The interviews were reviewed
        and general findings were grouped into themes. Results of the study indicate
        that staff members generally have positive experiences with family members
        and thought that involvement supported students\u2019 academic and social
        transitions into college, as well as their success. The consensus of the study
        was that family involvement benefitted students with Autism Spectrum Disorder
        and promoted success in postsecondary settings. These results and the themes
        will be explained further in the presentation.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        fingerprints with a secondary purpose of preservation as the sample fingerprints
        may be exposed to extreme conditions. The method employs physical vapor deposition
        of silver deposited on glass, plastic, paper and metal substrates. Varying
        thicknesses of silver ranging from 1.0 nm to 10.0 nm are deposited on substrates
        and examined for optimal spectral, transmittance and reflectance signals.
        Subsequent analysis repeats the spectral examination of latent fingerprints
        contained on the surfaces after the vapor deposition and addresses the optical
        properties and visualization methods of fresh and weathered latent prints.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        films 1946-1961</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>When Germany surrendered in
        May 1945, cultural life found itself at a standstill. In the west, the Allies
        took immediate control of the film industry, including the reeducation and
        denazification of German citizens, while the Soviets and German film personalities
        in the east began to rebuild the film industry with the establishment of the
        film studio DEFA in 1946. The aim of this research is to examine the role
        of German films produced between 1946 and 1961 in addressing and confronting
        the German experiences of the Nazi period and wartime. Films produced between
        1945 and 1961 attempted to address and confront the immediate past through
        representations of psychological trauma, criticisms of ordinary Germans and
        accountability, and the definition of gendered experiences of war and postwar
        society. Studying German postwar cinema is useful in understanding the ways
        that the Germans understood their immediate past, especially considering that
        the same questions relating to guilt and responsibility would reemerge in
        scholarly and public debate in the 1990s.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        varying quality.  Results of the study will be used to aid in recommendations
        to land managers regarding ideal landscapes for prairie restoration and conservation,
        in order to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. We incorporate
        scientific fieldwork, lab procedures, and data entry and analysis.  Our research
        team analyzed soil respiration gas samples, soil samples, and above- and belowground
        biomass samples to quantify carbon emissions and retention.  Additionally,
        terrain analyses are being conducted based on topographic and GPS measurements
        to determine optimal spatial orientation (i.e., slope, elevation, and exposure).
        &#xd;\nField research is conducted at Nachusa Grasslands, and in order to
        compare the carbon processes of prairies in two development stages, we chose
        one plot which was well-established and of high quality and one which was
        more recently restored and of poorer quality. We installed PVC rings in a
        grid-like formation across each plot, and used these to collect soil respiration
        gas samples for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen analysis. Additional
        data collection included extraction of soil cores from the immediate vicinity
        of each PVC ring for belowground biomass and soil bulk density analyses; and
        collection of vegetation in close proximity to each ring for aboveground biomass

        part of an effort to explore the Latino community and its history, the Latino
        Oral History Project looks to collect the oral histories of the descendents
        of families to learn more about migration patterns to the Chicagoland area
        and Northern Illinois alike. More specifically, observing how various ties
        to an area can impact the flow of migration to underdeveloped communities
        and how those ties have lead to the established Latino communities we see
        today. In conjunction with the Oral History 495 class, this project helps
        facilitate the research of students by archiving existing data on Latino studies
        such as migrant programs, schooling, housing discrimination, politics, etc.
        By creating these bibliographies, the students in turn add on the growing
        efforts to collect these stories. Ultimately, we look to archive, transcribe,
        and observe how these ties have led to the success of Latinos to thrive as
        we continue to see movement for more representation of this group of minorities.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        current study will focus on the impact of a calculus and physics Themed Learning
        Community (TLC) in order to compare to non-TLC sections on the Force Concept
        Inventory (FCI), which tests student\u2019s conceptual understanding of physics.
        TLCs offer classes with the same major, smaller size, and in conjunction with
        two or three related classes. For example, TLC calculus and TLC physics will
        have same students to create the connection. The focus of this study is on
        the physics program in the TLC.  The demographic data, such as ACT score,
        age, major and academic year, will be collected from fall 2014 General Physics
        I. This research will compare the FCI result for every freshman who is majoring
        in Engineering in TLC and non-TLC to see if the TLC has a significant impact
        on the students\u2019 learning of physics. The experiment will be performed
        as follows: I will choose the comparison group, who are freshmen, engineering
        majors, from both TLC and non-TLC students. Choosing those students are a
        necessary step because only engineering major freshman can join the TLC; it
        will also prevent any bias due to different ages and majors. The next step
        will be to investigate the pre- and post-test of FCI from both TLC and non-TLC
        students. The final step is to normalize the data and plot the point to see
        the distribution of FCI score. As a result the normalized score showed that
        TLC students performed significantly better than Non-TLC students.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        Act of 1978 and its role in the history of equal employment opportunity law
        in the United States. Although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed
        discrimination based on sex, many women continued to experience discrimination
        in hiring and on the job. A series of legal cases were filed between 1965
        and 1978 that challenged employer discrimination against pregnant women in
        particular. Court victories and lobbying by women\u2019s rights groups led
        Congress to take action in 1978 and pass the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.
        The Pregnancy Discrimination Act created specific rights for pregnant women
        to guarantee equal and fair treatment in the workplace and in health insurance.
        The importance of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is still evident today
        as the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a pregnancy discrimination case, Young
        v. United Parcel Service.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A. (Bachelor

        energy is investigated both in its role in the United States, as well as in
        Iceland.  The feasibility of geothermal energy for electricity production
        will be analyzed within a framework of technical, economic, environmental,
        and political implementation.  Key background information about geothermal
        energy as a resource, as well as technology used to capture this energy are
        explored initially.  The United States and Iceland\u2019s resource base differs,
        and does their approaches to utilize this renewable resource.  This analysis
        is demonstrative of the challenges any energy resource faces.  An assessment
        of the geothermal market at this time will lead to a general advisement on
        resource potential in the United States.  Iceland has made an amazing transformation
        from one of the poorest countries in Europe dependent upon peat and coal for
        its energy needs to becoming a global leader in renewable energy, creating
        an industry profiting from abundant power, and increasing the quality of life
        among its citizens.  The United States is currently the world leader in both
        geothermal electrical generation and deployment of geothermal heat pumps (Tester
        and Horne, 2014).  The question is, how many sites are truly suitable for
        Enhanced Geothermal Systems expansion?  With the highest grade reservoirs
        already discovered, are we able to, and should we, engineer more reservoirs

        ability to understand and condense research articles is crucial for success
        as an undergraduate psychology student; however, this does not come naturally
        to many students. Sommer et al. (2014) found that students tend to focus on
        operational definitions rather than constructs in their summaries even after
        a summary writing tutorial. The tutorial has been modified to focus on the
        relationship between constructs and operational definitions in research. The
        current study investigates the effectiveness of the summary writing tutorial
        in improving students\u2019 essays. Participants were twenty-six upper-level
        undergraduate psychology students enrolled in a psychology lab course who
        completed a digital tutorial and three article summaries as part of an in-class
        assignment. All students were assigned to read two psychology research articles
        in preparation for class. One class section was randomly assigned to the experimental
        group, in which participants individually completed a thirty-slide PowerPoint
        tutorial designed to help students focus on the most important and relevant
        details of a research article. They were then instructed to type summaries
        of the two previously assigned articles. Students in the other class section,
        which served as the control group, wrote their article summaries first and
        were then directed to complete the summary-writing tutorial. Participants\u2019
        summaries will be evaluated based on the presence of constructs (mention of
        the study\u2019s hypotheses) and operational definitions (mention of the study\u2019s
        methods and results). Summarizing performance of the experimental and control
        groups will be compared. Implications for intervention strategies, as well
        as suggestions for future research, will be discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        to the general population, college students have poorer sleep habits, which
        also tend to negatively affect their academic performance. Research suggests
        that part of this issue is due to technology use patterns among students.
        Given this context, it is important for students to manage the use of technology
        in order to protect their sleep time. The purpose of this study is to determine
        whether sleep and technology management training can increase positive behavioral
        outcomes in students. This study examines the efficacy of an educational training
        session that adds information pertaining to boundary creation around technology
        use around bedtime to the Sleep Treatment Education Program for Students (STEPS).
        By comparing the results of the enhanced training session (STEPS-TECH; n =
        30) to the original STEPS program (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30) using
        an experimental design, my goal is it to determine if making people aware
        of their technology use around sleep time can improve their sleep habits,
        technology boundary management, and academic/social burnout.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        Digital Design with FPGA prototyping being undertaken with Dr. Reza Hashemian
        involves using a Nexys 4 digital board created by Xilinx and manipulating
        it through a hardware design language to be able to incorporate in all sorts
        of technological devices. Some of the challenging components of this project
        are the slow learning process as progress is made, the Verilog Hardware Design
        language, the application of the digital board and FPGAs, and designing the
        technological component to be used in application. The most probable application
        I originally intended for this project was to develop a robotic vision system
        to get a map of whatever room the it is set up in and to target a certain
        object in that room. Things that needed to be considered were the comparison
        of robotics vision to the eyes of a human and that the vision the robot uses
        has two fixed points that would read two different distances when looking
        at a single point in space. After this, calculations would need to be made
        for the angle between these two lines to come up with a good estimate of how
        far that object is. Continuation of this project will allow for the advancement
        of the vision system development and a mobile robot component to be able to

        research examines the different representations of imperial women by two ancient
        Roman historians, Plutarch and Tacitus. While both historians wrote during
        the period from 60-117 C.E., their different positions within Roman imperial
        life affected their views of the empire and its people. I will argue that
        their individual ideas about morality and the Roman Empire contributed to
        their divergent depictions and descriptions. By analyzing each historian\u2019s
        own ideals, the historical context in which they wrote, and the varied scholarship
        regarding Roman imperial women, I hope to contribute a significant and original
        argument to this discussion. This comparative approach of two of Roman history\u2019s
        most influential writers will be integral to understanding more about imperial
        women during the Roman Empire.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A. (Bachelor

        psychologists theorizes that humans, as a species, have established sex differences
        in jealousy due to the male\u2019s fear of paternal uncertainty, and a female\u2019s
        desire for paternal caregiving that stem from our evolutionary past. This
        suggests a male is likely to be in more distress over sexual infidelity, while
        a female is more likely to be more distressed over emotional infidelity. Recently,
        new findings have suggested that these differences might be due to the male\u2019s
        ability to visualize sexually explicit images more vividly. A study will be
        done which has men and women answer a forced-choice infidelity dilemma, either
        with standard instructions or with instructions encouraging vivid imagery.
        Competing predictions will be tested, with the results supporting the evolutionary
        psychology theory or the recent challenge to it.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        colonies can have significant effects on island trophic structure by infusing
        massive amounts of guano fertilizer into terrestrial zones (Jones, 2010).
        These nutrients are important for driving soil chemical cycling and biotic
        communities including both plants and invertebrates. However, introduced invasive
        rats (Rattus spp.) threaten seabird populations globally by preying upon every
        life stage of nesting seabirds. The objective of this research is to quantify
        seabird influence on New Zealand island ecosystems using stable isotope analysis.
        We will take advantage of the fact that marine nitrogen and carbon are enriched
        in 15N and 13C compared to terrestrial nitrogen and carbon to track seabird
        influence through island food webs. By looking at stable isotopic forms of
        nitrogen and carbon (\u03B415N and \u03B413C) in soil, plant leaves, and spiders,
        we will quantify the amount of seabird-derived nutrient cycling throughout
        multiple trophic levels. We expect to find greater concentrations of marine-derived
        carbon and nitrogen in soils, leaves, and spiders in seabird colonies and
        lesser concentrations farther away from seabird colonies. Our research will
        provide managers with the means to measure progress towards restoration on
        the >1100 islands recovering from invasive predators with a single soil sample,
        and demonstrate the important roles seabirds play on islands ecosystems.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        training  now for their careers will be working with a  decidedly older population,
        as \u201Cbaby boomers\u201D age.  In addition, there are approximately one
        billion people across the globe with some form of disability,  around 15%
        of the world\u2019s population. How  prepared are healthcare workers of the
        future to  work with elderly people or people with disabilities?  What preconceived
        notions, or attitudes, do they  have that can help or hinder their success
        in working  with these populations? The best time to assess these  attitudes
        is while they are training to become those  healthcare workers, i.e., the
        pre-service period.  This study uses an approach to assessing  innermost feelings
        that people have about age and  disability, asking pre-service health care
        \ professionals (NIU students) to complete a sorting  exercise that measures
        truthful opinions toward  disabled/abled persons and young/old persons. The
        \ Implicit Association Test (IAT) accomplishes that  honesty by providing
        the participants with images  that correlate with abled/disabled and young/old
        \ persons and asking them to sort the items, along with  positively or negatively
        connoted words  (evaluations/stereotypes). The theory is that it is  easier
        (and thereby faster) to make a response when  the items that are more closely
        related share the  same response key (disabled and good, old and bad,  etc.).
        Results of this study may point to training needs  in areas identified by
        negative associations with  either disability or age.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        1 is a widespread enzyme found in Rickettsia prowazekii, a gram-negative bacteria
        that causes typhus and other diseases.  As such, it is critical to find active
        sites of MetAP 1 on Rickettsia prowazekii in order to find inhibitors through
        protein-ligand binding for antibiotic drug candidacy and development.  The
        program DockBlaster uses docking as a molecular modelling technique in order
        to predict the orientation of a ligand when binding to a protein. The PBD
        code for MetAP 1 (2B3H) from the RCSB database along with the corresponding
        ligand, glycerol (GOL), is submitted into DockBlaster.  After virtual screening,
        it was determined that MetAP 1 has six pockets into which an inhibitor ligand
        can bind.  In a future study, in vitro enzymatic assays for MetAP 1-inhibitor
        interactions will be conducted in order to screen for possible antibacterial

        research and artistry project involved the creation of two educational posters
        showing different manipulations that are involved with motion palpation, a
        chiropractic technique used to diagnose and treat patients. The posters I
        created are designed to be displayed in a chiropractor's office to be used
        as an educational tool and visually inform patients about this technique.
        To conduct my research, I analyzed literature, consulted with a chiropractor,
        and took my own references of each adjustment. After gathering information
        and references, I drew my illustrations and designed my posters. As a result,
        I have created two visual aids to help educate patients and promote conversation
        between chiropractors and their patients.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.

        Ground Metals</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>quality control vision system</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This
        project consists of the design and development of a quality control vision
        system. Round Ground Metals produces small diameter Swiss screw machine quality
        stainless steel bars that will acquire various defects on them during production.
        The project consists of replicating the factory process of the steel bars
        rotating/moving along the factory line and implementing a system consisting
        of a Cognex In-Sight 7000 series industrial grade camera working with the
        In-Sight Explorer 4.9.1 software to detect any defect along the steel bars.
        Along with the detection, this project will have the ability to mark the defect
        on the bar and display all of the data gathered from the Cognex into a visual
        display screen that lets the user know the distance from the end of the bar
        that the defect is at, the size of the defect, and whether or not the diameter
        of the steel bar falls into the provided thresholds. After design is completed
        and prototype testing has been sufficiently done in the lab, the final design
        will then be transferred to Round Ground Metals for them to fabricate and
        eventually implement into their factory line.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>B.A.
