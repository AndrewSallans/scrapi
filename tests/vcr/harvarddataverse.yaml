        \ surfaces in response to the need for areas that could be used in productive\
        \ activities requires that conservation efforts depend not only on the management\
        \ and conservation of the already protected areas but also on the encouragement\
        \ of conservation strategies that come from the very productive systems. Matigu\xE1\
        s faces many problems related to the loss and fragmentation of their habitats\
        \ due to cattle farming activities. Different studies emphasizing biodiversity\
        \ have been conducted but there is still little knowledge about the condition\
        \ or behaviour of the forest-dependent species that still remain in this highly\
        \ fragmented landscape. In an effort to generate knowledge of this type three\
        \ different forest-dependent species (Chiroxiphia linearis, Thryothorus rufalbus\
        \ y Thamnophilus doliatus) where selected to evaluate body condition and movements\
        \ along the landscape. Four different forest patches and a control were selected\
        \ where birds were captured and information about fat storage, muscle condition,\
        \ and weight was taken. Linear transects were located in three different habitat\
        \ types surrounding the forest patches to evaluate their usage. Furthermore\
        \ the T. rufalbus species was chosen to conduct a telemetry experiment to\
        \ gather information about movement and usage of the habitat in ten different\
        \ forest patches, five connected and other five isolated. Home ranges of the\
        \ individuals were constructed using the ArcView GIS 3.3 program and the Animal\
        \ Movement extension; the data used for this purpose was also utilized to\
        \ validate a structural connectivity proposal. Body condition resulted significant\
        \ (P = 0,0189) for the variable muscle in the C. linearis. Home ranges were\
        \ constructed for ten different individuals; a lmost all of the birds used\
        \ only forest patches during their daily movements, avoiding any other type\
        \ of habitat. Minimum friction values used to generate the structural connectivity\
        \ proposal match up with the habitats where the individuals moved during our\
        \ telemetry experiment. Forest patches remaining in this landscape are critical\
        \ for the T. rufalbus. There were very few observations of the focal species\
        \ outside forest patches. The preservation and increment of the amount and\
        \ size of forest patches and the connections between them is imperative in\

        \ LEK is being rapidly lost as indigenous livelihoods change. Biodiversity\
        \ loss is also a driver of the loss of LEK, but quantitative study is lacking.\
        \ In our study landscape in SW China, a large proportion of species have been\
        \ extirpated. Hence, we were interested to understand whether species extirpation\
        \ might have led to an erosion of LEK and the implications this might have\
        \ for conservation. So we investigated peoples\xE2\x80\x99 ability to name\
        \ a selection of birds and mammals in their local language from pictures.\
        \ Age was correlated to frequency of forest visits as a teenager and is likely\
        \ to be closely correlated to other known drivers of the loss of LEK, such\
        \ as declining forest dependence. We found men were better at identifying\
        \ birds overall and that older people were better able to identify birds to\
        \ the species as compared to group levels (approximately equivalent to genus).\
        \ The effect of age was also stronger among women. However, after controlling\
        \ for these factors, species abundance was by far the most important parameter\
        \ in determining peoples\xE2\x80\x99 ability to name birds. People were unable\
        \ to name any locally extirpated birds at the species level. However, contrary\
        \ to expectations, people were better able to identify extirpated mammals\
        \ at the species level than extant ones. However, extirpated mammals tend\
        \ to be more charismatic species and several respondents indicated they were\
        \ only familiar with them through TV documentaries. Younger people today cannot\
        \ experience the sights and sounds of forest animals that their parents grew\
        \ up with and, consequently, knowledge of these species is passing from cultural\
        \ memory. We suggest that engaging older members of the community and linking\

        gave their opinions of the condition of the national economy, the United States
        Congress, Vice President Dick Cheney, Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator John
        McCain, and the Democratic and Republican parties. A series of questions asked
        whether the war in Iraq was worth fighting, whether United States military
        forces should be increased, decreased, or maintained, whether progress was
        being made to restore civil order in Iraq and establish a democratic government,
        and whether the Bush Administration and the Democrats in Congress had a clear
        plan for handling the situation in Iraq. Views were also sought on the use
        of wiretapping and surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
        and the National Security Agency in conducting the war on terrorism, whether
        the government was doing enough to protect the rights of American citizens,
        and whether the country was safer from terrorism now, as compared to before
        September 11, 2001. Additional topics addressed the bird flu virus, the Terri
        Schiavo case, the recent controversy surrounding a merger deal that would
        give management of six United States ports to a company owned by the United
        Arab Emirates, the religion of Islam, and whether respondents and any of their
        friends and relatives were prejudiced against Muslims and Arabs. Demographic
        variables included sex, age, race, household income, education level, religious
        affiliation, political party affiliation, political philosophy, and type of
        residential area (e.g., urban or rural).","published_at":"2015-04-09T04:28:41Z","citation":"ABC

        Survey on the Importance of Nature to Canadians (the Nature Survey) is the
        result of a partnership of 16 federal, provincial andterritorial government
        agencies responsible for wildlife, water, forestry, tourism, and parks and
        protected areas. The 1996 survey was designed to update and enhance information
        from surveys co-sponsored by similar partnerships in 1981, 1987 and 1991 under
        the name Survey on the Importance of Wildlife to Canadians. The Nature Survey
        included questions similar to those in previous surveys on wildlife related
        activities and recreational fishing. It was expanded to include a new set
        of questions on outdoor activities in natural areas such as camping and boating,
        among others. The objectives of the Survey on the Importance of Nature to
        Canadians were to: A: Measure the social and economic importance of nature
        to Canadians by collecting information on nature-related activities, including
        activities such as viewing, studying and photographing nature, camping, andvarious
        nature-related sports such as hiking, boating, hunting and fishing. B: Provide
        basic, accurate and reliable data on nature-related activities that are homogenous
        across provincial/territorial boundaries C: With the help of the information
        from the survey, develop programs for the protection and sustainable use of
        t he natural environment.","published_at":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","citation":"Statistics
